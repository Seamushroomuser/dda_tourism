                                              <p>After the Asian Games ended in 1982, India received its first-ever amusement park in 1984. The famous mascot of Asian Games, 'Appu,' was the inspiration behind this park. It came up in Delhi, but it was shut down in 2008. The park reopened amidst anticipation from thrill-seekers in 2014 in Gurgaon. It houses Skyfall, the tallest ride in the country. The other rides worth exploring are Lazy & Crazy River, OMG, Typhoon Tunnel, Rapid Racer, and more. The amusement park also houses amazing restaurants, serving a variety of delicacies. Some of them are Southern Bay, Langkawi Bay, Aroma Coast, and Tidal Toast.</p>
